# enigma

**Functionality**

I would give myself a three on functionality, my code encrypts and decrypts through Enigma and works through encrypt and decrypt runner files that take command line input.


**Object Oriented Programming**

I would give myself a solid three on object oriented programming. My project is broken into five classes that all have a single purpose, each class is at most 50 lines, none of my lines of code exceed 80 characters, and my variable and method names have clear purpose. I attempted to make a module, and it works for two classes, but then late in the game my understanding was that they should work for any class, even outside of the project, and while it technically could be used outside the project, it is pretty specific to encoding something. In a future iteration, I would probably try turning it into a class with al class methods, or see if I could combine encryption and decryption effectively so not writing the same code twice.


**Test Driven Development**

I would give myself a 3 or 3.5 on test driven development. I wrote my tests before writing code (a couple lapses, I'll admit, when basically sandboxing to see what I even wanted the code to be giving me first), my rake and simplecov are returning 100%, I think my test names are clear, and I did use stubs for one test.


**Version Control**

I would give myself a 3.5 or 3.75 on version control. I have a ridiculous amount of commits, I worked very hard to make them hold single functionality, but I'll admit there were a few lapses when adding for instance the runners and it just made more sense to write it all out and run it instead of committing at multiple points. By the time this README is up, I will have 15 pull requests, and in every pull request I noted what was being merged to master, as well as possible refactors for a time in the future, and any time past refactor opportunities were resolved. I tried to make every commit message specific and clear, I think they were, but maybe looking back they would feel less so.
